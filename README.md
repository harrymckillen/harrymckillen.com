# Harry McKillen Dot Com

Based off my grunt skeleton project repo, this seeks to be a test bed for some of the latest web technologies. For this I will not be focusing on browser support. So things might not work well in every browser, and it's by design than omission. 


It has a few grunt modules install and pre-configured out-of-the-box. 

* Pug (formerly Jade)
* Sass - CSS preprocessor I tend to favour. 
* Basic FTP module for deploying your stuff to a server
* A few other basic npm modules which support the building of a 'dist' version of a website.
