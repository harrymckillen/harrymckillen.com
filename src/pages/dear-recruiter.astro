          <h1>Dear Recruiter</h1>

          <p>
            If you have reached out to me recently on LinkedIn, and I've
            directed you here, it's so that you have reached out with a job
            opportunity that you feel I am suitable for. I appreciate the time
            you have taken to reach out to me, and I hope you also appreciate
            that I frequently get contacted about job opportunities.
          </p>

          <h2>Do my skills match your requirements?</h2>
          <p>
            Quite often I get roles related to design, or specifically requiring
            X years of React experience to be considered. I've never really used
            React, and if I went forward for a role that didn't match my
            skillset, only to be knocked back for it, it's not something that
            would be worth my time. I know in advance what I know. I could
            absolutely learn React, but if your clients specific needs are for
            someone who has a predefined skillset, and a cursory glance of my
            CV/LinkedIn doesn't tell you I have it, then you're wasting both of
            our times.
          </p>

          <h2>What am I looking for?</h2>
          <p>
            I like to work in interesting industries, and on interesting
            products. I have worked in a few different companies over the years,
            and some have been quite niche.
          </p>

          <p>
            I typically look for companies where I can be an effective team
            player.
          </p>

          <p>
            I have had a number of roles in my career, including Leadership
            roles. But I am happiest when I am contributing to the development
            side of a product. Roles which offer an opportunity to grow into a
            Leadership role don't necessarily appeal to me, as I am really
            comfortable at a Senior Engineer level. I'm not seeking an
            Engineering Manager or Team Lead level role. I'm absolutely happy to
            provide mentorship to junior engineers in my Senior Engineer
            capacity, but I'm not looking to manage a team, having done so for a
            number of years already.
