title: "Importance of Leadership"
description: "This one has been a tricky one to write, as I started it over a year ago and a bunch of things had happened since, but it all feeds into my thoughts on what I consider to be good leadership. When I first started out, I put very little thought into the actual leadership abilities of those I worked with or for. When I landed my first job, like everyone, I was primarily focused on establishing myself, building my skillset and what projects I got to work on, as well the after work socialising. You kind of implicitly trust people in leadership roles know what they're doing, but with no real-world experience of what good leadership entails."

The bottom line is, yes, leadership matters. It is the one thing that will generally make me question staying in a company, because if the leadership team you interact with regularly is poor, and you lack faith in their vision and decision-making capabilities, that will entirely colour my view of the company. An oft cited stat is that something like 90% of people leave a company due to a bad leadership.

I have worked with a number of people in leadership positions, and it is important you as an team member understand what you value most in their leadership ability. You can learn what you don't like from having bad managers, as I have, just as much as what you value from a great leader.

For me, it boils down to whether on balance they value your contributions and they trust your experience and judgement. Nothing shakes my confidence faster than when a leader ignores your contribution. I do not mean they had to completely go over the top in supporting everything you suggest, as there are certain things which leaders need to balance to keep keep the overall team and stakeholders happy. However, naturally a Rubicon is crossed eventually people grow tired of where an organisation is headed in terms of direction. This can occur when a seriously bad decision is being made contrary to all available evidence, and your advice. Generally it's at this juncture, I tend to look further afield, because as much as you can be a team player, if you feel it is going in a bad direction, it can take the gloss off your time in a company.

## Bosses vs. Leaders

There is a clearcut distinction between working *with* or *for* someone. It is my belief that people who treat you as subordinate to them and remind you constantly of that fact are generally not great people to work for. They care about their stature and title, and conduct themselves in such a manner that you know you should be beneath them.

Leaders listen and learn how best to lead their team. They understand that everyone's personality differs, and how to get people to buy-in and how they can engage people within a team. I have worked with CTO's who talk to you as if you're a person, no heirs & graces.

Bosses care about optics, short-term results, and not exactly how they are achieved, nor the last impact to the team that the achieving of these results cost. They tend to rule by fear, and generally foster a blame culture. They want the plaudits when there are successes, but none of the failures or problems. As a result, if you notice a high turnover of staff, you'd probably be best joining them.

## Conclusion

Find yourself a leader who values your contributions, and focuses on resolving issues rather than focusing on who causes them. Sure, take key learnings on how to avoid mistakes in the future, but don't put up with a boss who rules with a culture of fear of making a mistake. I've been lucky and unlucky in equal measure.

However, with each person I have worked with, I have either appreciated what they brought to the table in terms of leadership and learned from it, or learned what I didn't like about their style, and have tried to avoid those mistakes when I have been in leadership positions.
