title: "Adding Reading Time to an Astro Blog"
description: "First off, I've seen a few rip-offs of this explainer from the recipes section of the Astro site, and this isn't a verbatim copy of that. Their solution didn't work out of the box for me, so I had to tweak it a bit."

I followed the [Astro Reading Time recipe](https://docs.astro.build/en/recipes/reading-time/) and it absolutely got me 90% of the way there. Being fresh to Astro, I assumed that magically it would all work as per the recipe. But the reading time appeared in the CLI when I ran `astro build`, but not on the page itself. Clearly it was something to do with the frontmatter, but I couldn't figure out what from the recipe. I searched a bit online and found a few articles people had largely ripped off from the Astro site, with no further explanation or troubleshooting. So I thought I'd write this up in case anyone else has the same issue. I found a Github issue that achieve the same thing with an alternative approach, but I wanted to stick with the recipe as much as possible.


`[...slug].astro`

```jsx
const { Content, remarkPluginFrontmatter } = await post.render();
post.data.minutesRead = 
remarkPluginFrontmatter.minutesRead; ðŸ‘ˆ the issue was I was rendering the post via a Layout
---

<BlogPost {...post.data} prevPost={post.prevPost} nextPost={post.nextPost}>
  <Content />
</BlogPost>
```
In the snippet about, I was passing the `post.data` to the `BlogPost` component, but I was rendering the `Content` component inside the `BlogPost` component. This meant that the `minutesRead` wasn't being passed to the `Content` component. So I moved the `minutesRead` to the `Content` component and it worked perfectly. So this may help someone else who is having the same issue, or is fresh to Astro like me.

You may also need to add the `minutesRead` to the schema in `config.ts` as it might be complain about it being an unknown property.

```ts
export const blogSchema = z.object({
  title: z.string(),
  description: z.string(),
  minutesRead: z.string().optional(), ðŸ‘ˆ I added this to the schema
  // Transform string to Date object
  pubDate: z.coerce.date(),
  updatedDate: z.coerce.date().optional(),
  tags: z.array(z.string()).optional(),
});
```
